## Overview
* This function is meant to interface with an image-to-text recognition program.

* Inputs are filtered to determine if the word 'tachycardic' is present.

* This program will return a True if the value is present and a False
if it is not present.


* This program will recognize inputs that are two letters "off" from the word
'tachycardia' as well as if two letters are not present.
